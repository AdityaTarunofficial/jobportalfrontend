- **React Hooks**: Utilized for state management and lifecycle events.

  - Secure user registration and login using forms.
  - Users can create accounts and access their personalized dashboard.
  
- **Job Search & Listings**: 
  - View and search through job listings.
  - Each job shows detailed information such as requirements and responsibilities.
  
- **Job Application**: 
  - Job seekers can apply for jobs directly from the job details page.
  - Track applications on the user's profile page.
  
- **Profile Management**: 
  - Users can edit their profiles, update contact information, and upload profile pictures.
  
- **Employer Job Management**: 
  - Employers can create, update, and delete job listings.
